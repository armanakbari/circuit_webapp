### Step-by-step Derivation

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?**
  There are three components in the circuit.
- **What types of components are they (R, C, L, etc.)?**
  The components are one voltage source (V1) and two resistors (R1, R2).
- **How are they connected to each other?**
  The voltage source V1, resistor R1, and resistor R2 are all connected in a single series loop.

**2. Impedances**
- The impedance of a resistor is its resistance, which is independent of the complex frequency 's'.
- Impedance of R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
- Impedance of R2: Z_R2(s) = R2
- The input voltage is V_in(s) = V1(s).
- The output voltage is the voltage across R2, V_out(s) = V_R2(s).

**3. Total Impedance**
- Since the resistors R1 and R2 are in series, the total impedance (Z_total) seen by the voltage source is the sum of their individual impedances.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s)
- Z_total(s) = R1 + R2

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output is taken across the resistor R2. The impedance of the branch associated with the output is simply the impedance of R2.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R2(s) = R2

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- The ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance is calculated as follows:
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Ratio = R2 / (R1 + R2)

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The circuit forms a voltage divider. The transfer function H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) is the ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance.
- V_out(s) = V_in(s) * (Z_out(s) / Z_total(s))
- H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Substituting the expressions from the previous steps:
- H(s) = R2 / (R1 + R2)
- This is the final simplified transfer function.
