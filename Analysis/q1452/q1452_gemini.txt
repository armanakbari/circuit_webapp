The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in for the given circuit.
The input voltage is V1.
The output is the voltage across the resistor R1. Let's call this V_R1.
So, H(s) = V_R1(s) / V1(s).

The circuit is a simple series RL circuit. I can find the transfer function using the voltage divider rule.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?** There are three components in the circuit.
- **What types of components are they?** There is one voltage source (V1), one inductor (L1), and one resistor (R1).
- **How are they connected to each other?** The voltage source V1, inductor L1, and resistor R1 are connected in a single series loop.

**2. Impedances**
- The impedance of a resistor is its resistance.
  - Z_R1(s) = R1
- The impedance of an inductor is s*L.
  - Z_L1(s) = s*L1
- The input voltage source in the s-domain is V1(s).

**3. Total Impedance**
- Since the components are connected in series, the total impedance (Z_total) seen by the voltage source is the sum of the individual impedances.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_L1(s)
- Z_total(s) = R1 + s*L1

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output voltage is measured across the resistor R1. Therefore, the impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of R1.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R1(s) = R1

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- The ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance is calculated for the voltage divider rule.
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Ratio = R1 / (R1 + s*L1)

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The transfer function H(s) is the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage, H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s).
- For a voltage divider, V_out(s) = V_in(s) * (Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)).
- Therefore, H(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s).
- Substituting the expressions from the previous steps:
- H(s) = R1 / (R1 + s*L1)
- This can be written in the standard form by rearranging the denominator.
- H(s) = R1 / (s*L1 + R1)
- This is the final simplified transfer function.
