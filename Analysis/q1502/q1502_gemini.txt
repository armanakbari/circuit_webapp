### 1. Component Identification
- **How many components are in the circuit?**
  There are 3 components in the circuit.
- **What types of components are they (R, C, L, etc.)?**
  The components are one independent voltage source (V1) and two resistors (R1 and R2).
- **How are they connected to each other?**
  The voltage source V1, resistor R1, and resistor R2 are all connected in a single closed loop, which means they are in series.

### 2. Impedances
- The impedance of a resistor is its resistance, which is constant with respect to frequency. In the s-domain:
- Impedance of R1: \(Z_{R1}(s) = R1\)
- Impedance of R2: \(Z_{R2}(s) = R2\)

### 3. Total Impedance
- The total impedance seen by the input voltage source V1 is the sum of the impedances of the components in the series loop.
- \(Z_{total}(s) = Z_{R1}(s) + Z_{R2}(s)\)
- \(Z_{total}(s) = R1 + R2\)

### 4. Output Impedance
- The output is the voltage across resistor R2. Therefore, the impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of R2.
- \(Z_{out}(s) = Z_{R2}(s) = R2\)

### 5. Impedance Ratio
- The ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance is calculated as follows:
- \(\frac{Z_{out}(s)}{Z_{total}(s)} = \frac{R2}{R1 + R2}\)

### 6. Final Transfer Function
- The circuit forms a voltage divider. The transfer function \(H(s) = V_{out}(s) / V_{in}(s)\) is the ratio of the output voltage (across R2) to the input voltage (V1). This ratio is equal to the impedance ratio calculated in the previous step.
- \(V_{in}(s) = V1(s)\)
- \(V_{out}(s) = V_{R2}(s)\)
- Using the voltage divider rule:
  \(V_{out}(s) = V_{in}(s) \times \frac{Z_{out}(s)}{Z_{total}(s)}\)
- Therefore, the transfer function is:
  \(H(s) = \frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)} = \frac{Z_{out}(s)}{Z_{total}(s)}\)
- \(H(s) = \frac{R2}{R1 + R2}\)
- This expression is already in its simplest form.
