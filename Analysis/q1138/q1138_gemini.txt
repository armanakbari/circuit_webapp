The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_R1(s) / V1(s) for the given circuit.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?** There are three components: a voltage source V1, a resistor R1, and a resistor R2.
- **What types of components are they?** One independent voltage source and two resistors.
- **How are they connected to each other?** The voltage source V1, resistor R2, and resistor R1 are connected in a single series loop.

**2. Impedances**
- The analysis is performed in the Laplace domain (s-domain). Since the circuit only contains resistors, their impedances are equal to their resistances and are not dependent on the complex frequency 's'.
- Impedance of resistor R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
- Impedance of resistor R2: Z_R2(s) = R2

**3. Total Impedance**
- The total impedance seen by the voltage source V1 is the sum of the impedances of the components in the series loop.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s)
- Z_total(s) = R1 + R2

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output is the voltage across resistor R1. The impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of R1.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R1(s) = R1

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- The ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance is calculated. This ratio is the core of the voltage divider rule.
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s) = R1 / (R1 + R2)

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The transfer function H(s) is the ratio of the output voltage V_out(s) to the input voltage V_in(s).
- In this circuit, V_in(s) = V1(s) and V_out(s) is the voltage across R1, V_R1(s).
- Using the voltage divider rule, the output voltage is the input voltage multiplied by the impedance ratio.
- V_out(s) = V_in(s) * (Z_out(s) / Z_total(s))
- H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- H(s) = R1 / (R1 + R2)
- The expression is already simplified and does not depend on 's'.
