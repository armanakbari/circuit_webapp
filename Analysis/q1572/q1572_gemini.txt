The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in for the given circuit, where V_in is the source V1 and V_out is the voltage across resistor R3. I will follow the specified step-by-step procedure.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?** There are four components: one voltage source (V1) and three resistors (R1, R2, R3).
- **What types of components are they?** The circuit consists of a voltage source and resistors.
- **How are they connected to each other?**
    - The diagram shows nodes 0 and 4 are connected by a wire, meaning they are the same electrical node.
    - Resistors R1 and R2 are both connected between node 4 and node 2. Since node 4 is the same as node 0, R1 and R2 are connected in parallel between the common node (0, 4) and node 2.
    - The voltage source V1 is connected between node 1 and node 0.
    - Resistor R3 is connected between node 1 and node 2.
    - Tracing the circuit loop: The voltage source V1 is in series with resistor R3 and the parallel combination of R1 and R2. This forms a simple series circuit. The output voltage is taken across R3.

**2. Impedances**
- In the s-domain (Laplace domain), the impedance of a resistor is its resistance value, which is independent of the complex frequency 's'.
- Impedance of R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
- Impedance of R2: Z_R2(s) = R2
- Impedance of R3: Z_R3(s) = R3

**3. Total Impedance**
- First, I'll calculate the equivalent impedance of the parallel combination of R1 and R2. Let's call this Z_p(s).
  Z_p(s) = (Z_R1 * Z_R2) / (Z_R1 + Z_R2) = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2)
- The total impedance of the circuit, Z_total(s), as seen by the source V1, is the sum of the impedances in the series loop.
  Z_total(s) = Z_R3 + Z_p(s)
  Z_total(s) = R3 + (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2)

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output is defined as the voltage across resistor R3. The impedance of the branch associated with the output is therefore the impedance of R3.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R3(s) = R3

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- Now, I will calculate the ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance.
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Ratio = R3 / (R3 + (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2))

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in is the ratio of the output voltage (across R3) to the input voltage (V1). For a series circuit, this is given by the voltage divider rule, which is exactly the impedance ratio calculated in the previous step.
- H(s) = V_R3(s) / V1(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- H(s) = R3 / (R3 + (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2))
- To simplify this expression, I will multiply the numerator and the denominator by (R1 + R2) to eliminate the complex fraction.
- H(s) = (R3 * (R1 + R2)) / ((R3 * (R1 + R2)) + ((R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2)) * (R1 + R2))
- H(s) = (R3 * (R1 + R2)) / (R3 * (R1 + R2) + R1 * R2)
- Expanding the terms in the numerator and denominator gives the final simplified form.
- H(s) = (R1*R3 + R2*R3) / (R1*R3 + R2*R3 + R1*R2)
- Reordering the denominator to a standard form:
- H(s) = (R1*R3 + R2*R3) / (R1*R2 + R1*R3 + R2*R3)

<answer>
H(s) = (R1*R3 + R2*R3) / (R1*R2 + R1*R3 + R2*R3)
