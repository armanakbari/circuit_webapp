The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in for the given circuit, where V_in is the source V1 and V_out is the voltage across the resistor R3. I will follow the requested step-by-step procedure.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?**
  There are 6 components in total: one voltage source (V1) and five resistors (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).
- **What types of components are they (R, C, L, etc.)?**
  The circuit contains one independent voltage source and five resistors.
- **How are they connected to each other?**
  All components (V1, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5) are connected in a single series loop.

**2. Impedances**
- The impedance of a resistor R in the s-domain is simply R.
- Impedance of R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
- Impedance of R2: Z_R2(s) = R2
- Impedance of R3: Z_R3(s) = R3
- Impedance of R4: Z_R4(s) = R4
- Impedance of R5: Z_R5(s) = R5

**3. Total Impedance**
- Since all the resistors are connected in series, the total impedance of the circuit (Z_total) is the sum of the individual impedances.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s) + Z_R3(s) + Z_R4(s) + Z_R5(s)
- Z_total(s) = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output voltage is the voltage across resistor R3. Therefore, the impedance associated with the output is the impedance of R3.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R3(s) = R3

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- Now, I will calculate the ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance.
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Ratio = R3 / (R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5)

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The circuit is a simple voltage divider. The output voltage V_out (voltage across R3) can be found using the voltage divider rule:
  V_out(s) = V_in(s) * (Z_out(s) / Z_total(s))
- The transfer function H(s) is the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage:
  H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Substituting the expressions from the previous steps:
  H(s) = R3 / (R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5)
- The expression is already in its simplest form. Since there are no frequency-dependent components (capacitors or inductors), the transfer function is a constant value and does not depend on 's'.
