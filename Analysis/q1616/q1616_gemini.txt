The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in for the given circuit, where V_in is the source V1 and V_out is the voltage across the resistor R2. I will follow the provided step-by-step instructions.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?**
  There are 5 components in total.
- **What types of components are they (R, C, L, etc.)?**
  There is one independent voltage source (V1) and four resistors (R1, R2, R3, R4).
- **How are they connected to each other?**
  All components are connected in a single series loop. The current flows from the positive terminal of V1, through R4, then R1, then R2, then R3, and back to the negative terminal of V1.

**2. Impedances**
The impedance of a resistor R in the s-domain is simply R.
- Impedance of R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
- Impedance of R2: Z_R2(s) = R2
- Impedance of R3: Z_R3(s) = R3
- Impedance of R4: Z_R4(s) = R4

**3. Total Impedance**
The total impedance seen by the input voltage source V1 is the sum of the impedances of all the resistors connected in series.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s) + Z_R3(s) + Z_R4(s)
- Z_total(s) = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4

**4. Output Impedance**
The output is the voltage across resistor R2. The impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of R2.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R2(s)
- Z_out(s) = R2

**5. Impedance Ratio**
Now, I will calculate the ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance.
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Ratio = R2 / (R1 + R2 + R3 + R4)

**6. Final Transfer Function**
The circuit is a simple voltage divider. The transfer function H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) is the ratio of the output impedance to the total series impedance.
- V_in(s) = V1(s)
- V_out(s) is the voltage across R2.
- Using the voltage divider rule: V_out(s) = V_in(s) * (Z_R2(s) / Z_total(s))
- H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) = Z_R2(s) / Z_total(s)
- H(s) = R2 / (R1 + R2 + R3 + R4)
- The expression is already in its simplest form.
