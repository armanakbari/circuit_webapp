The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in for the given circuit.
The input voltage is V_in = V1.
The output voltage is the voltage across the capacitor C1, so V_out = V_C1.
The circuit is a simple series RLC circuit, but without a resistor (R=0). The components are a voltage source V1, a capacitor C1, and an inductor L1, all connected in series.

I will use the voltage divider rule in the s-domain to find the transfer function.
H(s) = V_C1(s) / V1(s) = Z_C1(s) / (Z_C1(s) + Z_L1(s))

I will follow the requested step-by-step procedure.

**1. Component Identification**
- I will count the components in the diagram. There is one voltage source (V1), one capacitor (C1), and one inductor (L1). Total of 3 components.
- I will identify their types as requested.
- I will describe their connection. They form a single closed loop, which means they are connected in series.

**2. Impedances**
- I will write the impedance for each passive component in the s-domain.
- For capacitor C1, the impedance is Z_C1(s) = 1 / (s * C1).
- For inductor L1, the impedance is Z_L1(s) = s * L1.

**3. Total Impedance**
- The total impedance seen by the voltage source V1 is the sum of the impedances of the components in the series loop.
- Z_total(s) = Z_C1(s) + Z_L1(s).
- Z_total(s) = 1 / (s * C1) + s * L1.
- I can combine this into a single fraction: Z_total(s) = (1 + s^2 * L1 * C1) / (s * C1).

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output is the voltage across C1.
- The impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of the capacitor C1.
- Z_out(s) = Z_C1(s) = 1 / (s * C1).

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- I will calculate the ratio Z_out(s) / Z_total(s).
- Ratio = [1 / (s * C1)] / [(1 + s^2 * L1 * C1) / (s * C1)].
- The term (s * C1) in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator will cancel out.
- Ratio = 1 / (1 + s^2 * L1 * C1).

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The transfer function H(s) is the voltage divider ratio.
- H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s).
- This is the same as the ratio calculated in the previous step.
- H(s) = 1 / (1 + s^2 * L1 * C1).
- I will write this in the standard form, which is typically H(s) = 1 / (s^2 * L1 * C1 + 1). This is already in a simple and standard form.

The steps are clear and I have derived the final expression. I will now format the output as requested.
