The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_R1(s) / V1(s) for the given circuit. I will follow the specified step-by-step procedure.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?** There are three components: a voltage source V1, a resistor R1, and a resistor R2.
- **What types of components are they?** The components are one independent voltage source (V1) and two resistors (R1, R2).
- **How are they connected to each other?** The voltage source V1, resistor R1, and resistor R2 are connected in a single series loop.

**2. Impedances**
- The circuit is analyzed in the s-domain (Laplace domain).
- The impedance of a resistor is its resistance value, which is independent of frequency.
- Impedance of R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
- Impedance of R2: Z_R2(s) = R2

**3. Total Impedance**
- The total impedance, Z_total(s), seen by the voltage source V1 is the sum of the impedances of the components in the series loop.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s)
- Z_total(s) = R1 + R2

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output is the voltage across resistor R1. The impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of R1.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R1(s) = R1

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- The ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance is calculated. This ratio is used in the voltage divider rule.
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Ratio = R1 / (R1 + R2)

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The circuit is a simple voltage divider. The transfer function H(s) is the ratio of the output voltage (V_R1) to the input voltage (V1).
- H(s) = V_out / V_in = V_R1(s) / V1(s)
- Using the voltage divider rule, the output voltage is the input voltage multiplied by the impedance ratio calculated in the previous step.
- V_R1(s) = V1(s) * (Z_R1(s) / (Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s)))
- Therefore, the transfer function is:
- H(s) = R1 / (R1 + R2)
- The expression is already simplified and does not depend on 's' as it is a purely resistive circuit.
