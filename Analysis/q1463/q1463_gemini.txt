The user wants me to analyze a simple series circuit and find the transfer function H(s) = V_R1(s) / V1(s). I will follow the requested step-by-step procedure.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?**
  There are three components in the circuit.
- **What types of components are they?**
  The components are one independent voltage source (V1) and two resistors (R1 and R2).
- **How are they connected to each other?**
  The voltage source V1, resistor R1, and resistor R2 are all connected in a single loop, which means they are in series.

**2. Impedances**
- The impedance of a resistor is its resistance, which is independent of frequency.
- Impedance of R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
- Impedance of R2: Z_R2(s) = R2
- The voltage source V1 is the input, V_in(s) = V1(s).

**3. Total Impedance**
- Since the components R1 and R2 are in series, the total impedance (Z_total) seen by the voltage source is the sum of their individual impedances.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s)
- Z_total(s) = R1 + R2

**4. Output Impedance**
- The task is to find the transfer function to R1. This implies the output voltage (V_out) is the voltage across the resistor R1.
- The impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of R1.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R1(s) = R1

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- The ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance is calculated as follows:
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Ratio = R1 / (R1 + R2)

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The circuit is a voltage divider. The transfer function H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) is given by the voltage divider rule, which is the impedance ratio calculated in the previous step.
- V_in(s) = V1(s)
- V_out(s) = V_R1(s)
- H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- H(s) = R1 / (R1 + R2)
- The expression is already in its simplest form.
