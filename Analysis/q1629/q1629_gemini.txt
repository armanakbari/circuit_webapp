### Circuit Analysis Steps

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?**
  There are four components in the circuit.
- **What types of components are they (R, C, L, etc.)?**
  The components are one independent voltage source (V1) and three resistors (R1, R2, R3).
- **How are they connected to each other?**
  The voltage source V1 and the three resistors R1, R2, and R3 are all connected in a single series loop.

**2. Impedances**
- The impedance of a resistor in the s-domain is its resistance value.
- Impedance of R1: `Z_R1(s) = R1`
- Impedance of R2: `Z_R2(s) = R2`
- Impedance of R3: `Z_R3(s) = R3`

**3. Total Impedance**
- Since all the resistors are connected in series, the total impedance `Z_total(s)` seen by the voltage source is the sum of the individual impedances.
- `Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s) + Z_R3(s)`
- `Z_total(s) = R1 + R2 + R3`

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output is the voltage across the resistor R3. Therefore, the impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of R3.
- `Z_out(s) = Z_R3(s)`
- `Z_out(s) = R3`

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- The ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance is calculated as follows:
- `Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)`
- `Ratio = R3 / (R1 + R2 + R3)`

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The circuit forms a simple voltage divider. The transfer function `H(s)` is the ratio of the output voltage `V_out` (voltage across R3) to the input voltage `V_in` (V1). This ratio is equivalent to the impedance ratio calculated in the previous step.
- `H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) = V_R3(s) / V1(s)`
- `H(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)`
- `H(s) = R3 / (R1 + R2 + R3)`
- The expression is already in its simplest form. As the circuit contains only resistors, the transfer function is a constant gain and is independent of the complex frequency `s`.
