The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in for the given circuit.
The input V_in is the voltage source V1.
The output V_out is the voltage across the capacitor C1, which I will denote as V_C1.
So, the goal is to find H(s) = V_C1(s) / V1(s).

I will follow the requested step-by-step procedure.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?**
  There are 5 components in total: one voltage source (V1), three resistors (R1, R2, R3), and one capacitor (C1).
- **What types of components are they?**
  The components are a voltage source, resistors, and a capacitor.
- **How are they connected to each other?**
  The components V1, R3, R1, R2, and C1 are all connected in a single loop, which means they are in series.

**2. Impedances**
- I will represent each passive component's impedance in the Laplace domain (s-domain).
- Impedance of Resistor R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
- Impedance of Resistor R2: Z_R2(s) = R2
- Impedance of Resistor R3: Z_R3(s) = R3
- Impedance of Capacitor C1: Z_C1(s) = 1 / (s * C1)

**3. Total Impedance**
- The total impedance Z_total(s) seen by the voltage source V1 is the sum of the impedances of all components in the series loop.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R3(s) + Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s) + Z_C1(s)
- Z_total(s) = R3 + R1 + R2 + 1 / (s * C1)

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output voltage is the voltage across the capacitor C1.
- The impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of the capacitor C1 itself.
- Z_out(s) = Z_C1(s) = 1 / (s * C1)

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- I will calculate the ratio of the output impedance to the total impedance. This ratio is used in the voltage divider formula.
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- Ratio = (1 / (s * C1)) / (R1 + R2 + R3 + 1 / (s * C1))
- To simplify this complex fraction, I will multiply the numerator and the denominator by (s * C1).
- Numerator: (1 / (s * C1)) * (s * C1) = 1
- Denominator: (R1 + R2 + R3 + 1 / (s * C1)) * (s * C1) = s * C1 * (R1 + R2 + R3) + 1
- So, the simplified ratio is:
- Ratio = 1 / (1 + s * C1 * (R1 + R2 + R3))

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The transfer function H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) can be found using the voltage divider rule for a series circuit.
- V_in(s) = V1(s)
- V_out(s) = V_C1(s)
- V_out(s) = V_in(s) * (Z_out(s) / Z_total(s))
- H(s) = V_out(s) / V_in(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- This is the same as the impedance ratio calculated in the previous step.
- H(s) = 1 / (1 + s * C1 * (R1 + R2 + R3))
- This is the final, simplified transfer function in standard form for a first-order system.
