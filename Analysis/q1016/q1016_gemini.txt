The user wants me to find the transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in for the given circuit, where V_in is the source V1 and V_out is the voltage across the resistor R3. I will follow the requested step-by-step procedure.

**1. Component Identification**
- **How many components are in the circuit?**
  There are 6 components in the circuit.
- **What types of components are they (R, C, L, etc.)?**
  The components are:
  - V1: An AC voltage source (input).
  - R1, R2, R3: Three resistors.
  - C1: One capacitor.
  - L1: One inductor.
- **How are they connected to each other?**
  All the passive components (R1, R2, R3, C1, L1) are connected in series with the voltage source V1, forming a single closed loop.

**2. Impedances**
- The impedance of each passive component in the s-domain (Laplace domain) is as follows:
  - Impedance of Resistor R1: Z_R1(s) = R1
  - Impedance of Resistor R2: Z_R2(s) = R2
  - Impedance of Resistor R3: Z_R3(s) = R3
  - Impedance of Capacitor C1: Z_C1(s) = 1 / (s * C1)
  - Impedance of Inductor L1: Z_L1(s) = s * L1

**3. Total Impedance**
- Since all components are in series, the total impedance Z_total(s) seen by the input source V1 is the sum of the individual impedances.
- Z_total(s) = Z_R1(s) + Z_R2(s) + Z_R3(s) + Z_C1(s) + Z_L1(s)
- Z_total(s) = R1 + R2 + R3 + 1/(s*C1) + s*L1

**4. Output Impedance**
- The output voltage is taken across the resistor R3. Therefore, the impedance of the branch associated with the output is the impedance of R3.
- Z_out(s) = Z_R3(s) = R3

**5. Impedance Ratio**
- The ratio Z_out(s) / Z_total(s) is calculated using the expressions from steps 3 and 4. This ratio is used in the voltage divider rule to find the transfer function.
- Ratio = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s) = R3 / (R1 + R2 + R3 + s*L1 + 1/(s*C1))

**6. Final Transfer Function**
- The transfer function H(s) = V_out / V_in is found using the voltage divider principle. In this circuit, V_in = V1 and V_out = V_R3.
- H(s) = V_R3(s) / V1(s) = Z_out(s) / Z_total(s)
- H(s) = R3 / (R1 + R2 + R3 + s*L1 + 1/(s*C1))
- To simplify this expression and write it in a standard polynomial form, I will multiply the numerator and the denominator by 's'.
- H(s) = (s * R3) / (s * (R1 + R2 + R3) + s^2 * L1 + 1/C1)
- Now, I will rearrange the terms in the denominator in descending powers of 's'.
- H(s) = (s * R3) / (L1*s^2 + (R1 + R2 + R3)*s + 1/C1)

<answer>
H(s) = (s * R3) / (L1*s^2 + (R1 + R2 + R3)*s + 1/C1)
