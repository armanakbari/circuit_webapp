The switch in the circuit shown in the provided circuit image has been in position a for a long time. At $t=0$, the switch moves from position a to position b. The switch is a make-before-break type; that is, the connection at position b is established before the connection at position a is broken, so there is no interruption of current through the inductor. How many milliseconds after the switch has been moved does the inductor voltage equal 24 V ?
