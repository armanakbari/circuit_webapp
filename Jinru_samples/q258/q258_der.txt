The Thévenin voltage for the circuit to the left of the terminals $a, b$ is

$$
V_{\mathrm{Th}}=\frac{150}{180}(360)=300 \mathrm{~V} .
$$


The Thévenin resistance is

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}}=\frac{(150)(30)}{180}=25 \Omega
$$


Replacing the circuit to the left of the terminals $a, b$ with its Thévenin equivalent gives us the circuit shown in the provided circuit image, which indicates that $R_L$ must equal $25 \Omega$ for maximum power transfer.
