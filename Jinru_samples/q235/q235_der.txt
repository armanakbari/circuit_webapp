$i_o$ is the current in the $1.6 \Omega$ resistor, so we find the current $i_o$, by using the formula for current division:

$$
i_o=\frac{16}{16+4}(10)=8 \mathrm{~A}
$$

We now can further divide $i_0$, between the $6 \Omega$ and $4 \Omega$ resistors. The current in the $6 \Omega$ resistor is

$$
i_6=\frac{4}{6+4}(8)=3.2 \mathrm{~A}
$$

and the power dissipated in the $6 \Omega$ resistor is $p=(3.2)^2(6)=61.44 \mathrm{~W}$.
