The series $R L C$ circuit shown in the provided circuit image has a center frequency of $\sqrt{1 / L C}=1 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$, a bandwidth of $R / L=1 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$, and thus a quality factor of 1 . Use scaling to compute new values of $R$ that yield a circuit with the same quality factor but with a center frequency of 500 Hz . Use a $2 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor.
