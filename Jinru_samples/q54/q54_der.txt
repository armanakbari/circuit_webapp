Because the $6 \Omega$ resistor is in series with the $3 \Omega$ resistor, the energy dissipated and the percentage of the initial energy stored will be twice that of the $3 \Omega$ resistor:

$$
w_{6 \Omega 2}(\text { total })=1236.48 \mathrm{~mJ} .
$$

and the percentage of the initial energy stored is $45.80 \%$. We check these calculations by obscrving that

$$
1236.48+618.24+845.27=2699.99 \mathrm{~mJ}
$$

and

$$
31.31+22.90+45.80=100.01 \%
$$


The small discrepancies in the summations are the result of roundoff errors.
