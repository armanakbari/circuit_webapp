The externally applied test voltage source is denoted $v_T$, and the current that it delivers to the circuit is labeled $i_T$. To find the Th√©venin resistance, we simply solve the circuit shown in the provided circuit image for the ratio of the voltage to the current at the test source; that is, $R_{\mathrm{Th}}=v_T / i_T$. From the provided circuit image,

$$
\begin{aligned}
i_T & =\frac{v_T}{25}+20 i \\
i & =\frac{-3 v_T}{2} \mathrm{~mA}
\end{aligned}
$$


We then substitute and solve the resulting equation for the ratio $v_T / i_T$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
i_T=\frac{v_T}{25}-\frac{60 v_T}{2000}, \\
\frac{i_T}{v_T}=\frac{1}{25}-\frac{6}{200}=\frac{50}{5000}=\frac{1}{100} .
\end{gathered}
$$

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}}=\frac{v_T}{i_T}=100 \Omega .
