Because the voltage is given in terms of its rms value, the current also is rms. The load voltage is the product of the load current and load impedance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{L}} & =(39+j 26) \mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{L}}=234-j 13 \\
& =234.36 \angle-3.18^{\circ} \mathrm{V}(\mathrm{rms}) .
\end{aligned}
