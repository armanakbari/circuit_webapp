The schematic is shown in the provided circuit image (The schematic in the provided circuit image includes the output results, implying that it is the schematic displayed on the screen after the simulation.) Notice that the voltage-controlled voltage source E1 in the provided circuit image is connected so that its input is the voltage across the $4-\Omega$ resistor; its gain is set equal to 3 . In order to display the required currents, we insert pseudocomponent IPROBES in the appropriate branches. The schematic is saved as and simulated by selecting Analysis/Simulate. The results are displayed on IPROBES as shown in the provided circuit image and saved in output file exam311.out. From the output file or the IPROBES, we obtain $i_1=i_2=1.333 \mathrm{~A}$ and $i_3=2.667 \mathrm{~A}$.
