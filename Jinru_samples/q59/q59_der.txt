To find the Thévenin equivalent resistance with respect to the capacitor terminals, we use the testsource method, where $v_T$ is the test voltage and $i_T$ is the test current. For $v_T$ expressed in volts, we obtain

$$
i_T=\frac{v_T}{10}-7\left(\frac{v_T}{20}\right)+\frac{v_T}{20} \mathrm{~mA} .
$$


Solving for the ratio $v_T / i_T$ yields the Thévenin resistance:

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}}=\frac{v_T}{i_T}=-5 \mathrm{k} \Omega
$$


With this Thévenin resistance, we can simplify the circuit.

For $t \geq 0$, the differential equation describing the circuit is

$$
\left(5 \times 10^{-6}\right) \frac{d v_o}{d t}-\frac{v_o}{5} \times 10^{-3}=0
$$


Dividing by the coefficient of the first derivative yields

$$
\frac{d v_o}{d t}-40 v_o=0
$$


We now use the separation of variables technique to find $v_c(t)$ :

$$
v_o(t)=10 e^{40 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0
$$
