To find $v_C(t)$, we can use either of the following relationships:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_C=-\frac{1}{C} \int_0^t i d \tau+100 \text { or } \\
& v_C=i R+L \frac{d i}{d t}
\end{aligned}
$$


Whichever expression is used (the second is recommended), the result is

$$
v_C(t)=(100 \cos 9600 t+29.17 \sin 9600 t) e^{-2800 t} \mathrm{~V}, \quad t \geq 0
$$
