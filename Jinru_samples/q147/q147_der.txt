We calculate the maximum average power delivered to $Z_{\mathrm{L}}$ from the circuit, in which we replaced the original network with its Th√©venin equivalent. The rms magnitude of the load current $\mathbf{I}$ is

$$
I_{\mathrm{eff}}=\frac{19.2 / \sqrt{2}}{2(5.76)}=1.1785 \mathrm{~A}
$$

The average power delivered to the load is:
P=I_{\mathrm{eff}}^2(5.76)=8 \mathrm{~W} .
