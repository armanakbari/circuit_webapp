We begin by removing the $125 \Omega$ and $10 \Omega$ resistors, because the $125 \Omega$ resistor is connected across the 250 V voltage source and the $10 \Omega$ resistor is connected in series with the 8 A current source. We also combine the series-connected resistors into a single resistance of $20 \Omega$. 
We now use a source transformation to replace the 250 V source and $25 \Omega$ resistor with a 10 A source in parallel with the $25 \Omega$ resistor. We can now simplify the circuit by using Kirchhoff's current law to combine the parallel current sources into a single source. The parallel resistors combine into a single resistor. Hence $v_o=20 \mathrm{~V}$.
