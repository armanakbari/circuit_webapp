A balanced three-phase Y-connected generator with positive sequence has an impedance of $0.2+j 0.5 \Omega / \phi$ and an internal voltage of $120 ~ V / \phi$. The generator feeds a balanced three-phase Y-connected load having an impedance of $39+j 28 \Omega / \phi$. The impedance of the line connecting the generator to the load is $0.8+j 1.5 \Omega / \phi$. The a-phase internal voltage of the generator is specified as the reference phasor. The provided circuit image is the a-phase equivalent circuit of the system. Calculate the $\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{aA}}$ (positive phase sequence).
