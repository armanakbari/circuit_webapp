The Y-connected source feeds a $\Delta$-connected load through a distribution line having an impedance of $0.3+j 0.9 \Omega / \phi$. The load impedance is $118.5+j 85.8 \Omega / \phi$. Use the a-phase internal voltage of the generator as the reference. The provided circuit image is a single-phase equivalent circuit of the three-phase system. Calculate the total complex power delivered to the $\Delta$-connected load .
