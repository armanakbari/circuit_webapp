We begin by noting that the $3 \Omega$ resistor is in series with the $6 \Omega$ resistor. We therefore replace this series combination with a $9 \Omega$ resistor, reducing the circuit. We now can replace the parallel combination of the $9 \Omega$ and $18 \Omega$ resistors with a single resistance of $(18 \times 9) /(18+9)$, or $6 \Omega$. Then you can verify that $i_s$ equals $120 / 10$, or 12 \mathrm{~A}.
