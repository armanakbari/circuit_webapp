Now we attach a $10 \Omega$ resistor to the device in the provided circuit image to complete the circuit. Kirchhoff's current law tells us that the current in the $10 \Omega$ resistor is the same as the current in the $5 \Omega$ resistor. Using Kirchhoff's voltage law and Ohm's law, we can write the equation for the voltage drops around the circuit, starting at the voltage source and proceeding clockwise:

$$
-30+5 i+10 i=0
$$


Solving for $i$, we get

$$
i=2 \mathrm{~A}
$$


Because this is the value of current flowing in the $10 \Omega$ resistor, we can use the power equation $p=i^2 R$ to compute the power delivered to this resistor:

$$
p_{10 \Omega}=(2)^2(10)=40 \mathrm{~W}
$$
