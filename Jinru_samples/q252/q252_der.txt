If we study the circuit shown in the provided circuit image, knowing that the power associated with the 6 V source is of interest, several approaches come to mind. The circuit has four essential nodes and six essential branches where the current is unknown. Thus we can find the current in the branch containing the 6 V source by solving either three $[6-(4-1)]$ mesh-current equations or three $[4-1]$ node-voltage equations. Choosing the mesh-current approach involves solving for the mesh current that corresponds to the branch current in the 6 V source. Choosing the node-voltage approach involves solving for the voltage across the $30 \Omega$ resistor, from which the branch current in the 6 V source can be calculated. But by focusing on just one branch current, we can first simplify the circuit by using source transformations.

We must reduce the circuit in a way that preserves the identity of the branch containing the 6 V source. We have no reason to preserve the identity of the branch containing the 40 V source. Next, we can replace the parallel combination of the $20 \Omega$ and $5 \Omega$ resistors with a $4 \Omega$ resistor. This $4 \Omega$ resistor is in parallel with the 8 A source and therefore can be replaced with a 32 V source in series with a $4 \Omega$ resistor. The 32 V source is in series with $20 \Omega$ of resistance and, hence, can be replaced by a current source of 1.6 A in parallel with $20 \Omega$. The $20 \Omega$ and $30 \Omega$ parallel resistors can be reduced to a single $12 \Omega$ resistor. The parallel combination of the 1.6 A current source this branch, we can transform the 40 V source in series with the $5 \Omega$ resistor into an 8 A current source in parallel with a $5 \Omega$ resistor. and the $12 \Omega$ resistor transforms into a voltage source of 19.2 V in series with $12 \Omega$. The current in the direction of the voltage drop across the 6 V source is $(19.2-6) / 16$, or 0.825 A . Therefore the power associated with the 6 V source is
