An ammeter model consists of an ideal ammeter in series with a $20-\Omega$ resistor. It is connected with a current source and an unknown resistor $R_x$ as shown in the provided circuit image. The ammeter reading is noted. When a potentiometer $R$ is added and adjusted until the ammeter reading drops to one half its previous reading, then $R=65 \Omega$. What is the value of $R_x$ ?
