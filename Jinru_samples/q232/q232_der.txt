We begin by noting that the $3 \Omega$ resistor is in series with the $6 \Omega$ resistor. We therefore replace this series combination with a $9 \Omega$ resistor, reducing the circuit to the one shown then we now can replace the parallel combination of the $9 \Omega$ and $18 \Omega$ resistors with a single resistance of $(18 \times 9) /(18+9)$, or $6 \Omega$. Then you can verify that $i_s$ equals $120 / 10$, or 12 A . 

We added the voltage $v_1$ between nodes $x$ and $y$ to help clarify the subsequent discussion. Using Ohm's law we compute the value of $v_1$ :

$$
v_1=(12)(6)=72 \mathrm{~V}
$$


But $v_1$ is the voltage drop from node x to node y , so we can return to the circuit and again use Ohm's law to calculate $i_2$. Thus,

$$
i_2=\frac{v_1}{9}=\frac{72}{9}=8 \mathrm{~A} 
$$
