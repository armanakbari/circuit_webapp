The switch has been in position a for a long time, so the capacitor looks like an open circuit. Therefore the voltage across the capacitor is the voltage across the $60 \Omega$ resistor. From the voltagedivider rule, the voltage across the $60 \Omega$ resistor is $40 \times[60 /(60+20)]$, or 30 V . As the reference for $v_C$ is positive at the upper terminal of the capacitor, we have $v_C(0)=-30 \mathrm{~V}$.
