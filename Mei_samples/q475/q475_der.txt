Solution:

The current source has been replaced with an open-circuit equivalent, and the resistance determined between terminals $a$ and $b$.



In this case an ohmmeter connected between terminals $a$ and $b$ would send out a sensing current that would flow directly through $R_1$ and $R_2$ (at the same level). The result is that $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in series and the Thévenin resistance is the sum of the two.



$$

R_{T h}=R_1+R_2=4 \Omega+2 \Omega=6 \Omega

In this case, since an open circuit exists between the two marked terminals, the current is zero between these terminals and through the $2-\Omega$ resistor. The voltage drop across $R_2$ is, therefore,

$$
V_2=I_2 R_2=(0) R_2=0 \mathrm{~V}
$$

and

$$
E_{T h}=V_1=I_1 R_1=I R_1=(12 \mathrm{~A})(4 \Omega)=48 \mathrm{~V}
