A balanced three-phase wye-connected generator delivers power to a balanced three-phase delta-connected load through a line as shown In the provided circuit image. Line impedance, per phase load impedance and generator voltage are $Z_L=2 \mid 15^{\circ} \Omega$, $Z_{\Delta}=12 \beta 0^{\circ} \Omega$ and 230 V rms , respectively. For ABC phase sequence, calculate the line currents I_{\mathrm{Bb}}.
