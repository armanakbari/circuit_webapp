Considering the overall system, we know that the current entering must equal that leaving. Therefore,

$$
I_7=I_1=\mathbf{1 0 ~ A}
$$


Since 10 A are entering node $a$ and 12 A are leaving, $I_3$ must be supplying current to the node.

Applying Kirchhoff's current law at node $a$,
and

$$
\begin{gathered}
I_1+I_3=I_2 \\
10 \mathrm{~A}+I_3=12 \mathrm{~A} \\
I_3=12 \mathrm{~A}-10 \mathrm{~A}=\mathbf{2} \mathbf{A}
\end{gathered}
