With $g_m=0$, the output impedance, and hence $A$, are infinity. The two loop gains are obtained from Figs. 8.79(b) and (c) as $T_{s c}=0$ and $T_{o c}=\infty$, respectively. These difficulties arise because the proof of Blackman's theorem divides by $A$, tacitly assuming that $A<\infty$. One can avoid this situation by placing a resistor in parallel with the port of interest and letting it approach infinity in the end result. This is left as an exercise for the reader.
