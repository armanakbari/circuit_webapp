Solution
Using the half-circuit concept and replacing the ideal current sources with transistors, we obtain the equivalent depicted in Fig. 9.35. The voltage gain from $X$ to $P$ is approximately equal to $g_{m 5} R_{\text {out } 1}$, where $R_{\text {out } 1} \approx\left[g_{m 7} r_{O 7}\right.$ $\left(r_{O 9} \| r_{O 5}\right)\left\|\|\left(g_{m 11} r_{O 11} r_{O 13}\right)\right.$. Thus, $R_{\text {out }} \approx g_{m 3} r_{O 3} r_{O 1} g_{m 5} R_{\text {out } 1}$. In essence, since the output impedance of a cascode is boosted by a folded-cascode stage, the overall output impedance is similar to that of a "quadruple" cascode.
