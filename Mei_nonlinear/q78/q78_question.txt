Rechargeable batteries must be charged by a constant current (rather than a constant voltage) to avoid damage. The battery charger must therefore generate a constant current from a golden reference, $V_{R E F}$. As shown in the provided circuit image, we can insert a small resistor $r$ in the output current path, apply the voltage across $r$ to an amplifier $A_1$, and subtract the output of $A_1$ from $V_{R E F}$. Calculate the output current of this circuit, assuming $\left|Z_L\right| \ll r_O$ (the output resistance of $\left.M_1\right)$.
