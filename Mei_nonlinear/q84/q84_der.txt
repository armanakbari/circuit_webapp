The circuit consists of two common-source stages, with $R_F$ and $R_S$ sensing the output voltage and returning a fraction thereof to the source of $M_1$. This transistor subtracts the returned voltage from $V_{i n}$. The reader can prove that the feedback is indeed negative. Following the procedure illustrated in Fig. 8.53, we identify $R_F$ and $R_S$ as the feedback network and construct the open-loop circuit as shown in Fig. 8.54(b). Note that the loading effect in the input network is obtained by shorting the right terminal of $R_F$ to ground and that in the output by leaving the left terminal of $R_F$ open. Neglecting channel-length modulation and body effect for simplicity, we observe that $M_1$ is degenerated by the feedback network and

To compute the closed-loop gain, we first find the loop gain as $g_{21} A_{v, \text { open }}$. Recall from (8.64) that $g_{21}=V_2 / V_1$ with $I_2=0$. For the voltage divider consisting of $R_F$ and $R_S, g_{21}=R_S /\left(R_F+R_S\right)$. The closed-loop gain is simply equal to $A_{v, \text { closed }}=A_{v, \text { open }} /\left(1+g_{21} A_{v, \text { open }}\right)$.
