Since the circuit employs voltage feedback at the output, the output impedance is equal to the open-loop value, $r_{O P} \| r_{O N}$, divided by one plus the loop gain, $1+g_{m N}\left(r_{O P} \| r_{O N}\right)$. In other words, for large open-loop gain, the closed-loop output impedance is approximately equal to $\left(r_{O P} \| r_{O N}\right) /\left[g_{m N}\left(r_{O P} \| r_{O N}\right)\right]=1 / g_{m N}$.
