The circuit consists of two common-source stages, with $R_F$ and $R_S$ sensing the output voltage and returning a fraction thereof to the source of $M_1$. This transistor subtracts the returned voltage from $V_{i n}$. The reader can prove that the feedback is indeed negative. Following the procedure illustrated in Fig. 8.53, we identify $R_F$ and $R_S$ as the feedback network and construct the open-loop circuit as shown in Fig. 8.54(b). Note that the loading effect in the input network is obtained by shorting the right terminal of $R_F$ to ground and that in the output by leaving the left terminal of $R_F$ open. Neglecting channel-length modulation and body effect for simplicity, we observe that $M_1$ is degenerated by the feedback network and
