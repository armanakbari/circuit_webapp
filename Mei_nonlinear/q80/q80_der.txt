In this circuit, the capacitive divider $C_1-C_2$ senses the output voltage, applying the result to the gate of $M_1$ and producing a current that is subtracted from $I_{i n}$. The open-loop transimpedance equals that of the core common-gate stage, $R_D$. The loop gain is obtained by setting $I_{i n}$ to zero and breaking the loop at the output [Fig. 8.36(b)]:
