Noting that the source of $M_1$ is at ac ground, we write the gain as

$$
A_v=-g_{m 1}\left[r_{O 1}\left\|r_{O 2}\right\|\left(1 / g_{m 2}\right)\right]
$$


Since $V_{\text {out }}=V_{D D}-\left|V_{G S 2}\right|$, the maximum allowable dc level of $V_{\text {in }}$ is equal to $V_{D D}-\left|V_{G S 2}\right|+V_{T H 1}$.
