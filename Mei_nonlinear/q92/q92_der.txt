In this circuit, $R_S$ and $R_F$ sense the output current and return a fraction thereof to the input. Breaking the loop according to Fig. 8.65, we arrive at the circuit in Fig. 8.66(b), where we have

$$
A_{I, \text { open }}=-\left(R_F+R_S\right) g_{m 1} R_D \frac{1}{R_S \| R_F+1 / g_{m 2}}
$$


The loop gain is given by $h_{21} A_{I \text {,open }}$, where, from (8.62), $h_{21}=I_2 / I_1$ with $V_2=0$. For the feedback network consisting of $R_S$ and $R_F$, we have $h_{21}=-R_S /\left(R_S+R_F\right)$. The closed-loop gain equals $A_{I, \text { open }} /\left(1+h_{21} A_{I, \text { open }}\right)$.
