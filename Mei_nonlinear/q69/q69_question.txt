A differential pair with current-source loads can be configured to act as a large "floating" resistor. Illustrated in the provided circuit image, the idea is to bias $M_1$ and $M_2$ at a very small current so as to obtain a high incremental resistance between $A$ and $B$, approximately equal to $1 / g_{m 1}+1 / g_{m 2}$. Determine the noise associated with this resistor. Neglect channel-length modulation.
