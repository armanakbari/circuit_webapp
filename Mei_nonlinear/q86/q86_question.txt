A PMOS current source delivers a current to a load, e.g., the rechargeable battery. We wish to make this current less PVT-dependent by means of negative feedback. As shown in the provided circuit image, we convert the output current to voltage by a small series resistor, $r_M$, compare this voltage with a reference by means of an amplifier, and return the result to the gate of $M_1$. Determine the output current seen by the load.
